## Introduction
In our **Introduction to Computer Science course (CSL1010)**, we set out to create a cool text editor using C programming. Our team consisting of three members joined forces to build a tool that's not the general text editor you use.
Meet our Team
- Nitin Verma
- Agastya Singh, and
- Kukatlapalli William Samuel
## Our Vision
Imagine a text editor that does more than just basic stuff. We wanted to make a tool that's handy for different sorts of tasks, from simple word counting to fancy distribution analysis.

## Features Highlights
Here's what our text editor can do:
- **Word and Line Counting**: Need to know how many words or lines in your text file? Our editor's got your back.
- **Emoji Fun**: Make your text files look attractive by easily adding emojis wherever you want.
- **Word Counting**: Quickly find out how many times a word appears in your file.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Keep your secrets safe with built-in encryption and decryption features.
- **File Magic**: Merge multiple text files effortlessly and give them new names too.
- **Time Stamp**: Add dates and times wherever you need them in your file.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Dig into your mathematical variation distribution of data for insights.
- **Content Handling**: Peek at specific lines or whole files, and tweak text or delete lines as needed.
- **Arrange Words Alphabetically**: Wanna sort n number of names in order, Hey,put them in text and you got them sorted.

## Our Journey
Building this text editor wasn't just about coding; it was an activity that helped us building team spirit and work together towards a concentrated goal. We had to brainstorm ideas, look for possible and effective solutiions.

## Gratitude!
We extend gratitude to our Instructors, who got us this opportunity to interact with our peers. It was fun as well as challenging at the same time, But consistent guidance from the course instructor and all the the Teachings assistants (TAs) made our journey smoother.
